notes

When a user registers a new application, you will need to save that registration and associate it with the user. 

Generate a registered application model that is associated with the user. 

The model should have a name and URL attribute.

  rails g model registered_application name:string url:string 

  check model (model.rb)(db/migrate)

  rake db:migrate 

With the registration model created, generate registered_applications_controller.rb with the appropriate CRUD actions.

  rails g controller registered_applications index create show destroy 

A user should see an index of all their registered applications. 

Complete the index action and views. 

Fill out the create action and views. 

The create action and views should create a new registration associated with a user.

Build out the read action and views as well. 

The read view should display the registered application's name and URL. 

Lastly, construct the delete action to de-register and destroy an existing application registration.
